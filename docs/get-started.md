## :robot: App Install

Get it on your favorite app store or find the current release for your operating system on the [releases page](https://github.com/TomBursch/kitchenowl/releases).
Please take a quick look at [Tips & Tricks](tips-and-tricks.md) to get the best experience in the app.

## üóÑÔ∏è Server Install

You can either install only the backend or add the web-app to it. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is required.
There are three tags available: `latest`, `beta` and `dev`. `latest` is the most current stable release and is the default. `beta` corresponds to the most recent prerealese and might have some experimental features. The `dev` tag is directly build from the main branch and should not be used in production. Release notes can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/TomBursch/kitchenowl/releases).

=== "Backend and Web-app (recommended)"

    Recommended using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

    1. Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/TomBursch/kitchenowl-backend/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
    ```
    version: "3"
    services:
        front:
            image: tombursch/kitchenowl-web:latest
            environment:
            - FRONT_URL=http://localhost # The url the instance will be access with
            ports:
            - "80:80"
            depends_on:
            - back
            networks:
            - default
        back:
            image: tombursch/kitchenowl:latest
            restart: unless-stopped
            networks:
            - default
            environment:
            - JWT_SECRET_KEY=PLEASE_CHANGE_ME
            - FRONT_URL=http://localhost
            volumes:
            - kitchenowl_data:/data

    volumes:
        kitchenowl_data:

    networks:
        default:
    ```
    2. Change default values such as `JWT_SECRET_KEY` and the URLs (corresponding to the ones your instance will be running on)
    3. Run `docker-compose up -d`

=== "Backend only (legacy)"

    Using docker cli:

    ```
    docker volume create kitchenowl_data
    ```

    ```
    docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name=kitchenowl --restart=unless-stopped -v kitchenowl_data:/data tombursch/kitchenowl:latest
    ```

!!! danger "Important"
    We recommend running KitchenOwl behind a reverse proxy with https (e.g. [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html]))
    
    It is also important that you have HTTP Strict Forward Secrecy enabled and the proper headers applied to your responses or you could be subject to a javascript hijack.

## Reverse Proxy Setup

Docker-Compose.yml Setup

```
    version: "3"
    services:
        front:
            image: tombursch/kitchenowl-web:latest
            environment:
            - FRONT_URL=https://sub.domain.com  #Add your Reverse Proxy domain here
            ports:
            - "9090:80" #You Can change the first port to anything you want just make sure you change the back end to match it
            depends_on:
            - back
            networks:
            - default
        back:
            image: tombursch/kitchenowl:latest
            restart: unless-stopped
            networks:
            - default
            environment:
            - JWT_SECRET_KEY=PLEASE_CHANGE_ME
            - FRONT_URL=http://localhost:9090  #Change the local port to what you have put in front end ports ie. :9090
            volumes:
            - kitchenowl_data:/data

    volumes:
        kitchenowl_data:

    networks:
        default:
    ```


## ‚è´ Migrating from Older Versions
Starting from version 0.0.33 the frontend routes requests to the backend. Thus only one port has to be accessible. However, the backend can be hosted in standalone mode as it was before (see legacy server install).
